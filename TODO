-------------- Short term --------------------

- Clean the NAMESPACE
- Get things clearer on the S4/S3 methods
- Put some sample data (and document it)
- Push the SpatialSpectraDataFrame class
- Find a quick way to use the baseline package (wrapper)

------------- Longer term --------------------

- File-based storage of big collections
- Integration of a viewer, possibly using playwith, to 
manipulate (eg crop) the spectra in a collection.
